# Instructions for input data and code
### Figure 1
**S1.R**: R scripts used to generate the culmulation curve of vOTUs \
**S2.R**: R scripts used to examine the difference in isoelectric points of viral proteins between AMD and groundwater \
vConTACT2 \
**new-upset.R**: R scripts used to generate the upset plot in Fig. 1
### Figure 2
**Distance-decay analysis.R**: R scripts used to generate distance-decay relationships (DDRs) based on Bray-Curtis similarity of viral community compositions \
**Multivariate regression tree.R**: R scripts used to generate multivariate regression tree analysis modeling viral community composition against physicochemical gradients with sum of squares partitioning
